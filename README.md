N-Queens solution using: 
- Hill climbing search 
- Hill climbing search with sideways moves
- Random-Restart Hill-Climbing search without sideways move
- Random-Restart Hill-Climbing search with sideways move.
# Input:
The program takes 2 inputs: 
- number of queens
- number of runs
# Output: 
For the given number of runs, four random search sequences are displayed along with the statistics for the given number of runs. The statistics includes the success percentage, failure percentage, average number of steps taken in case of success and failure. 
The output is generated for cases where the solution is found using basic hill climbing search, hill climbing search with sideway moves, Random-Restart Hill-Climbing search without sideways move, Random-Restart Hill-Climbing search with sideways move.
# Other Details:
Details about the statistics of each algorithm mentioned in the pdf document.
